1. Compiling:
-------------_

Install latest drivers for your Nvidia graphic cards.

make sure latest CUDA sdk/runtime is installed (nvcc).
gnu C/C++ compilers are "not" necessary. 

If your CUDA capable GPU is of compute capability 2 (Fermi), you can use the makefile as such.
If not please replace the following tag in the Makefile based on the architecture.

'-arch compute_20' to '-arch compute_30' or '-arch compute_10'


If everything is set correctly. typing

make

will build the program TrajXCUDA.cux in the same directory.

2. Running the program:
-----------------------_

The program needs different input files based on what you want to use it for. 
The mandatory file is 'input.dat'. You can find a copy of it in example/ folder.
This tells TrajXCUDA what to compute. 

The next main input file is the trajectory itself in XYZ format named 'input.xyz'.

When all input are ready, just type

./TrajXCUDA.cux

3. Example:

An example 'input.xyz' and 'input.dat' are provided in the example/ folder
